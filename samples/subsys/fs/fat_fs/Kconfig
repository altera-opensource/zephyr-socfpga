	help
	  Name of the disk drive to be used by sample application.

	int "Device connection wait value"

	help
	  Before using devices like USB wait for the enumeration process to
	  complete. The wait value configured is in seconds.

config SAMPLE_FATFS_CREATE_SOME_ENTRIES
	bool "When no files are found on mounted partition create some"
	default y
	help
	  In case when no files could be listed, because there are none,
	  "some.dir" directory and "other.txt" file will be created
	  and list will run again to show them. This is useful when
	  showing how FAT works on non-SD devices like internal flash
	  or (Q)SPI connected memories, where it is not possible to
	  easily add files with use of other device.
